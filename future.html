<p class="pageText">
		Catherine Hunter has an overall positive lookout for the future, she thinks that the world can work to overcome any problems that they might face in the upcoming decades. She thinks that th future could look something like the images above in the next century or so, but it would require an agreed upon change by everyone living in massive cities to completely redesign them. The technology is nt there yet for flying cars, but it is currently being developed and could be available to consumers in the next few years.</p>
